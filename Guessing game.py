Exercise #4
Write the pseudocode for a program where the player and the computer trade places in the number guessing game.
That is, the player picks a random number between 1 and 100 that the computer has to guess.
Before you start, think about how you guess. If all goes well, try coding the game.

#To initialize a random number from 1 to 100
